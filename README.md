## About the project
This project marks the beginning of my coding journey, where I ventured into the world of software development on my own. Self-taught and driven by passion, I embarked on this adventure to create something unique, steering away from the conventional and ordinary.

Of course that it's just my journey outset, and I will continue acquire new knowledge and skills.

So enjoy the project, and I will be glad to get your feedbacks :) <br><br><br>
